# GG auto follower

#### Intro

Takes a list of the supposed ringleaders of GG, looks at their follower lists. Generates a list of people following more than one account.

This does not rank users. It doesn't look at bios, it doesn't look at hashtags.

#### Dependencies

Requires Net::Twitter which has a huge level of crazy deps.

If you add CHSommers or Adam Baldwin back to the list of users, it's going to take a really long time to run because of API limits. Ugh. Literally the worst, Twitter. Be less annoying.
